  1. What's the relationship between REST and CRUD?
Each REST command is centered around a resource. In REST, a resource is really anything that can be pointed to via HTTP protocol. For example, an image, a website, a document, or a weather service. The possibilities are almost endless.

In plain terms, REST stands for Representational State Transfer, an architectural style designed for distributed hypermedia, or an Application Programming Interface. Youâ€™ve probably heard the latter referred to as an API. Another way to think of an API is to define it as a web service that conforms to the architectural principles of REST. Each API is called by issuing a standard HTTP request method: POST, GET, PUT, and less commonly, DELETE. DELETE is usually implied, though not necessarily stated.
  1. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
  1-set the server 
  2- create routes  (test & / & * )
3- connect the db with the server 
4- send req from front-end 
5-then do what ever you want.
