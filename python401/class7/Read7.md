# Jupyter Lab
  - JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and    extensible manner. For a demonstration of JupyterLab and its features,
  - JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats

# NumPy

  ## What is NumPy?
   - NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
   - It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
   - NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
   - NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
  ## Why Use NumPy?
   - In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
   - NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
   - The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
   - Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important
