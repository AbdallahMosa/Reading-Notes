## Basic Patterns: Ordinary Characters
  - You can easily tackle many basic patterns in Python using ordinary characters
      ```  
            pattern = r"Cookie"
            sequence = "Cookie"
            if re.match(pattern, sequence):
                print("Match!")
            else: print("Not a match!")
   

## shutil 
  - The shutil module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. In particular, functions are provided which support file copying and removal. For operations on individual files, see also the os module.
  - copyfile() copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError if it does not have permission to write to the destination file.
   
              ``` # shutil_copyfile.py 
                    import glob
                    import shutil

                    print('BEFORE:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))

                    shutil.copyfile('shutil_copyfile.py', 'shutil_copyfile.py.copy')

                    print('AFTER:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))
