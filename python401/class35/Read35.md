# Authentication
  - Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a person or device. It typically involves verifying the person's or device's credentials, such as a username and password, in order to confirm that they are who or what they claim to be. Authentication is often used as part of the process of granting access to a system, service, or resource. It is an important security measure that helps to ensure that only authorized individuals or devices are able to access sensitive information or systems.

## Why is authentication important in cybersecurity?
  - Authentication is important in cybersecurity because it helps to ensure that only authorized individuals or devices are able to access sensitive systems, services, or resources. This helps to protect against unauthorized access or tampering, which can lead to data breaches, identity theft, and other security incidents. By requiring users to authenticate themselves before being granted access, organizations can help to ensure that only authorized individuals are able to access sensitive information, and that any unauthorized access is detected and prevented.
 
 
 # Authentication  AND authorization
  - Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a person or device. It typically involves verifying the person's or device's credentials, such as a username and password, in order to confirm that they are who or what they claim to be.
  - Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting or denying access to a system, service, or resource based on the authenticated identity of the person or device. It involves determining what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform, and what resources they are allowed to access.
  - In short, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, while authorization is the process of determining what they are allowed to do.
  - For example, a user might be required to authenticate themselves by providing a username and password before being granted access to a particular system. Once they have been authenticated, the system would then use authorization controls to determine what actions the user is allowed to perform, and what resources they are allowed to access within the system.
