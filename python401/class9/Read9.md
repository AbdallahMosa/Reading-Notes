# data structures
## What is the data structure
 - A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
### Why are data structures important? 
  - As the name indicates, Data Structure is used for organizing the data in memory. There are various ways of organizing the data in the memory, for eg. array, list, stack, queue, and many more
### How are data structures used?
  1. Storing data. Data structures are used for efficient data persistence, such as specifying the collection of attributes and corresponding structures used to store records in a database management system.
  2. Managing resources and services. Core operating system (OS) resources and services are enabled through the use of data structures such as linked lists for memory allocation, file directory management and file structure trees, as well as process scheduling queues.
  3. Data exchange. Data structures define the organization of information shared between applications, such as TCP/IP packets.
  4. Ordering and sorting. Data structures such as binary search trees -- also known as an ordered or sorted binary tree -- provide efficient methods of sorting objects, such as character strings used as tags. With data structures such as priority queues,programmers can manage items organized according to a specific priority.
  5. Indexing. Even more sophisticated data structures such as B-trees are used to index objects, such as those stored in a database.
  6. Searching. Indexes created using binary search trees, B-trees or hash tables speed the ability to find a specific sought-after item
  7. Scalability. Big data applications use data structures for allocating and managing data storage across distributed storage locations, ensuring scalability and performance. 

#### Data types 
  1. Boolean
  2. integer
  3. Floating-point numbers, which store a formulaic representation of real numbers.
  4. Fixed-point numbers, which are used in some programming languages and hold real values but are managed as digits to the left and the right of the decimal point.
  5. Character
  6. Pointers
  7. String

# LinkedList  
#### What is LinkedList  ?
  - A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

### Types of Linked List
  1. Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.
  2. Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.
  3. Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.
### Basic Operations
  1. Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.
  2. Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.
  3. Display − Displays the complete list.
  4. Search − Searches an element using the given key.
  5. Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.
