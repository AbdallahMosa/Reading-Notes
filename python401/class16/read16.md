## What is cryptography? 
  - techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents

##  Types of Cryptography
  1. Hashing : Hashing is a type of cryptography that changes a message into an unreadable string of text for the purpose of verifying the messageâ€™s contents, not hiding the message itself.
  2. Symmetric Cryptography : This type of cryptography uses a single key to encrypt a message and then decrypt that message upon delivery.
  3. Asymmetric Cryptography : Asymmetric cryptography (as the name suggests) uses two different keys for encryption and decryption, as opposed to the single key used in symmetric cryptography.
  4. Key Exchange Algorithms : A key exchange algorithm, like Diffie-Hellman, is used to safely exchange encryption keys with an unknown party.
 
 
 ## The 4 Types of Cryptographic Functions
  - Authentication
  - Nonrepudiation
  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
