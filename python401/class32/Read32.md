# Intro to Next.js & Tailwind CSS

# What is Next Js
  - Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications.
# advantages of using Next.js:
  1. Server-side rendering: Next.js allows you to easily create server-rendered React applications. This can improve the performance of your app, as the initial HTML payload is delivered to the client already rendered, rather than having the client wait for the JavaScript to execute before rendering the page.
  2. Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically splits your code into chunks that are only loaded when needed, which can help to improve the performance of your app by reducing the amount of code that needs to be downloaded on initial load.
  3. Static export: Next.js allows you to easily export your app as a set of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which can be deployed to a static hosting service like GitHub Pages or Netlify. This can be a cost-effective way to host your app, and can also improve performance by removing the need for a server-side component.
  4. Routing: Next.js provides a simple, declarative routing API that allows you to easily define and manage the routes in your app.
  5. Tooling: Next.js includes a number of built-in tools and features that can help you to develop and deploy your app more efficiently, such as hot reloading and automatic transpilation and bundling of your code.
