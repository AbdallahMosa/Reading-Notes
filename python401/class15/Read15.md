# Tree
## Why Tree Data Structure? 
  - Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.

## Tree Terminologies

  - Root : It is the topmost node of a tree.
  - Height of a Node : The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node).
  - Depth of a Node  : The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
  - Height of a Tree : The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.
  - Degree of a Node : The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.
  - Forest : A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.

## Types of Tree 
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
  - AVL Tree
  - B-Tree
 
 
## Tree Applications
  - Binary Search Trees(BSTs) are used to quickly check whether an element is present in a set or not.
  - Heap is a kind of tree that is used for heap sort.
  - A modified version of a tree called Tries is used in modern routers to store routing information.
  - Compilers use a syntax tree to validate the syntax of every program you write.
