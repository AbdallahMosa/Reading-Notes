# Graphs
  - A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Directed vs Undirected
  ## Undirected Graphs
   - An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
  
  ## Directed Graphs (Digraph)
   - A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
   - Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

  ## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
   - Complete Graphs : A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
   - Disconnected : A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
   - Connected : A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

 ## Real World Uses of Graphs 
  - GPS and Mapping
  - Driving Directions
  - Social Networks
  - Airline Traffic
  - Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
