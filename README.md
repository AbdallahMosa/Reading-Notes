1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

   | SQL    | NoSQL |
   | ----------- | ----------- |
   | For complex queries            |   not good fit for complex queries          |
   |     vertically scalable whereas        |     horizontally scalable        |
   |          	table based databases   |     document based, key-value pairs        |
   |          primarily called as Relational Databases   |    primarily called as non-relational or distributed database         |
   |        Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres   |   MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb          |
   1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Numeric data types such as int, tinyint, bigint, float, real etc.

   1. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? Column-oriented Graph

   1. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? SQL > NoSQL

  1. What does SQL stand for? Structured Query Language
  1. What is a relational database? A relational database is a collection of information that organizes data in predefined relationships where data is stored in one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, making it easy to see and understand how different data structures relate to each other. Relationships are a logical connection between different tables, established on the basis of interaction among these tables.
  1. What type of structure does a relational database work with? rwos and columns 
  1
  1. What is a NoSQL database?NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.
